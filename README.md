# NYOKA_snake_game
NYOKA is a simple snake game whereby the snake in yellow grows by picking 'food' in green.
The player can control the direction of the snake using arrow keys or other designated controls. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is facing, and the player must navigate it around obstacles and prevent it from colliding with the walls or its own body.
The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake grows longer, making it harder to avoid collisions. The player's score is usually based on the number of food items the snake consumes. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the grid or itself.The caption "HII IMEENDA" dispalys when the game ends loosely translating to GAME OVER.
